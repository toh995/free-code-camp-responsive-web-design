Here you can see my work for the final projects for the **Responsive Web Design** certificate from [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). I completed my [certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/toh995/responsive-web-design) on April 12, 2020.

The curriculum covers basic HTML and CSS. Some of the CSS concepts include flexbox and grid layout, media queries, and general principles for responsive web design.

You can see the original prompts for the final projects [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/).
